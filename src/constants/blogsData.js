      <div className="text-white">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">The Struggle with Frozen UIs in Flutter Apps</h2>
  <p>
    The struggle with frozen user interfaces (UIs) in apps can be frustrating. Flutter developers often face this issue when performing heavy tasks that block the main thread, leading to a poor user experience. Fortunately, Dart isolates offer a solution to keep UIs responsive while handling demanding operations.
  </p>
  
  <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Understanding the Problem: UI-Blocking Operations in Flutter</h3>
  <h4>The Main Thread's Role</h4>
  <p>
    The main thread is responsible for drawing the UI and processing user inputs. When the main thread is busy with intensive tasks, the app cannot respond promptly, causing irritating lags and freezes.
  </p>
  <h4>Resource-Intensive Tasks and UI Freezes</h4>
  <p>
    Some operations, like processing large datasets or retrieving JSON files, require substantial resources. Performing these tasks on the main thread can create a bottleneck, significantly affecting app performance.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Real-world Example: Processing Large Datasets</h4>
  <p>
    Imagine loading a long list of movies from a JSON file. If this operation runs on the main thread, users may experience delays and a locked UI. This situation can drive users away from your app, resulting in a loss of engagement.
  </p>

  <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Introducing Dart Isolates: Offloading Heavy Tasks</h3>
  <h4>What are Dart Isolates?</h4>
  <p>
    Dart isolates allow for concurrent execution of code. Each isolate runs in its own memory space, making it efficient for long-running tasks without disrupting the main thread.
  </p>
  
  <h4>How Isolates Prevent UI Blocking</h4>
  <p>
    Using isolates enables heavy computational tasks to occur in the background. This separation ensures the main thread remains free to handle user interactions, keeping the app responsive.
  </p>

  <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Benefits of Using Isolates in Flutter</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved Performance: UI remains smooth, even during heavy processing.</li>
    <li>Better User Experience: Users can interact with the app without frustration.</li>
    <li>Enhanced Scalability: Isolates allow building more complex applications without performance hits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Implementing Isolates with the compute Method</h3>
  <h4>Step-by-Step Guide: Integrating Isolates into Your Flutter App</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new method to load your data using an isolate.</li>
    <li>Set the loading state to true.</li>
    <li>Retrieve the JSON file.</li>
    <li>Utilize the compute method to execute the heavy task and pass the JSON string.</li>
    <li>Once completed, update the loading state and display the fetched data.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h4>Code Example: Loading JSON Data with Isolates</h4>
  <pre className="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto">
        <code className="text-sm text-gray-200">
          {`Future<List<Movie>> loadMovies() async {
  // Set loading state
  isLoading = true;

  // Retrieve JSON file
  final jsonString = await rootBundle.loadString('assets/movies.json');

  // Use compute to run the heavy task in an isolate
  final movies = await compute(parseMovies, jsonString);

  // Update loading state
  isLoading = false;
  return movies;
}

List<Movie> parseMovies(String jsonString) {
  // Parse JSON data and return a list of movies
}`}
        </code>
      </pre>
  
  <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>UI Still Freezes: Ensure heavy tasks run exclusively on the isolate.</li>
    <li>Data Not Loaded: Confirm JSON retrieval and parsing are correct.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Optimizing Your Flutter App with Isolates: Best Practices</h3>
  <h4>Choosing the Right Tasks for Isolates</h4>

    Not all tasks need isolates. Focus on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Large data processing</li>
    <li>Image processing</li>
    <li>Network calls that take time</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Managing Communication Between Isolates and the Main Thread</h4>
  <p>
    Use SendPort and ReceivePort to exchange messages. This ensures smooth data transfer without blocking the UI.
  </p>

  <h4>Performance Testing and Optimization</h4>
  <p>
    Regularly check your app's performance. Use tools to identify bottlenecks and adjust your isolate implementations accordingly.
  </p>
